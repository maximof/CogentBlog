# CogentPHP
A Simple PHP MVC Framework aimed at simplifying development process by interfacing works of great developers

## What is the Framework aimed to do ?

	The Framework is aimed to Simplify development process by making transaction available at the command line using Symphony Console Component.

## How is it aimed to be Developed ?

	Using the Console Component, will ease the stress of Creating Routes, APIs, Form Helpers, Database Migration, Controllers and Method Calls, View Rendering without writing any single line of code.

	The Console is to work in way similar to how npm init does. Yeah, just exactly like a form were the only thing you need to do is just to give answers to question that you are being asked by the Console **LOL** 

	It will be achieved by having Elegant Syntax Like 

		- php cogent Create:Routes 

		- php cogent Create:API

		- php cogent Create:formhelper

		- php cogent Create:migration


	Thats just an example of what I have in mind. I hope there are developers out there willing to contribute to this simple project.

	All we are trying to do is to simplify development process for newbies and and also create a flexible way of doing things rather than writing tiring codes.

	Whilst doing this, I am trying not to reinvent the wheel. 

	Current third party project included in this Framework are:

	Though some of them are not used yet haha

	Opis/database
	Opis/closure
	Opis/cache
	Opis/http-routing
	Opis/routing
	Opis/container
	Opis/session
	Opis/storages
	predis/predis
	twig/twig

This is a project that is just a few days old, lets join hands together and build something great. Lets Build
